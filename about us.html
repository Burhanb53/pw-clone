                <h2><b>Know the story behind PW:</b></h2><br><br>

                <h3>Alakh Pandey sir began his journey of teaching in 2014, and since 2016, he has been teaching online
                    courses, including IIT, JEE mains, JEE advance, NEET and NDA to his students on YouTube for free. In
                    the
                    beginning, he was so concerned and depressed with the result of low insights on his channel but
                    because
                    of his clear intention towards his dream of providing free knowledge to the needy, he never gave up
                    and
                    uploaded videos daily with the same enthusiasm. Soon after the beginning of the digital era students
                    started to follow him and his easy tricks on the internet, with asking more of it. Students love the
                    easy ways of communicating and solving tough problems.<br><br>

                    He proved his conscience in 2020 when institutes were pulling back from students amid the pandemic,
                    he
                    launched an app called PW, where he started new batches (Named as Lakshya, Arjuna, Prayas, Yakeen,
                    Neev,
                    Udaan, Shakti, Shaurya, Accelerate, et Cetra.), which were designed with student affordability in
                    mind.
                    The goal was to cover the entire course for Science students at the lowest possible cost so that
                    they
                    wouldn't have to give up their goals of changing the world due to financial constraints.<br><br>

                    The batches of PW began with the goal of offering education to the needy and diligent while ignoring
                    the
                    majority of the market, which was primarily concerned with money.<br><br>

                    Student's ascension began when they joined hands with PW to learn about the unique strategy of
                    passing
                    these examinations and fell in love with the learning method. PW aims to make students succeed in
                    their
                    goal with the minimal cost they can afford, said Alakh Pandey, the Founder of Physics Wallah</h3>

                forced to adopt the new ways because of COVID19,hence Pathshala has been launched to provide students
